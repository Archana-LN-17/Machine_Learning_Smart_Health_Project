# Machine_Learning_Smart_Health_Project1
Week1_Project1_Files
This is part of the first assignment Project 1 for the Machine Learning for Smart Health Systems Course by Omdena.

The information about all the records available on the Physionet for the Apnea-ecg database have been downloaded and initianl analysis has been performed using various plots and graphs.
The python code for the same is provided in the https://github.com/archana-coding21/Machine_Learning_Smart_Health_Project1/blob/main/Apnea_Physionet_dataset%20.ipynb

Next, the individual records have been downloaded from the Physionet database for performing HRV Analysis. The HRV Analysis application has been used for this purpose but it coudd not function properly. Kubios HRV also did not accept all the file formats and hence the feature extraction has been performed using the python code.

The code used for the feature extraction is in this link:
